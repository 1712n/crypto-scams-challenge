In the months leading up to September 2023, a group of scammers in Taiwan managed to defraud over $1.6 million from at least 10 victims. Their scheme began with luring victims through the LINE messaging app, initially convincing them to invest in stocks before shifting their focus to promoting Tether. After gaining the victims' trust, they guided them in setting up cryptocurrency wallets and directed them to fake websites and apps controlled by the scammers. Subsequently, the fraudsters withdrew and transferred the victims' funds to an undisclosed recipient to avoid detection. In September, the Taiwanese police arrested and charged these four scammers.
