###### 2021-09

In a swift and devastating turn of events, the popular NFT project Evolved Apes fell victim to a rug pull scheme in September 2021. The developer, known as "Evil Ape," brazenly made off with 798 ETH, valued at approximately $2.7 million, just a week after the project's official launch. This nefarious act left investors stunned and the project's promises shattered. Despite the rug pull, the NFTs remained listed on OpenSea, with Evil Ape continuing to profit from subsequent sales. In response to this betrayal, a group of resilient investors devised a plan: Fight Back Apes. This new initiative aims to fulfill the unkept promises of Evolved Apes, offering a beacon of hope to disillusioned NFT holders. To prevent a recurrence of such scams, Fight Back Apes plans to implement a multi-signature wallet system, ensuring transactions require approval from multiple parties. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the necessity for thorough research and scrutiny in the crypto realm, highlighting the importance of skepticism in the face of alluring yet dubious investment opportunities.

###### 2014-2022

A significant crypto hack targeted crypto whales and early investors, affecting wallets created between 2014 and 2022. The attackers stole over $10 million worth of ETH and other tokens, including 5,000 ETH (about $10 million at current rates), using various wallet types. Unfortunately, there is no information about fund recovery efforts, and the hack remains unresolved. To mitigate such risks, crypto users are advised to diversify assets across different wallets rather than keeping them all in one.
