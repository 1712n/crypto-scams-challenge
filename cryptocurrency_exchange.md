On June 6, 2023, the Japanese developer of cybersecurity solutions Trend Micro released the results of an analysis of a large-scale fraudulent campaign, during which more than 1,000 sites were involved. In about three months, the attackers stole about $5 million in cryptocurrency from users from Russia and the CIS.

According to the results of the investigation, cybercriminals have been operating since at least 2021. They operate through the Impulse Project affiliate program, which is controlled by the Impulse Team. This program is advertised on a number of Russian-language criminal forums. After creating an account on a fraudulent platform, the user is asked to activate the account by making a small deposit in cryptocurrency: in return, the scammers promise huge profits from subsequent transactions. However, in reality, the victim does not receive any benefit, and the funds provided go to the criminals.

Recently, a multi-stage DoubleFinger downloader was discovered that delivers the GreetingGhoul stealer to users' computers in Europe, the United States and Latin America. The attack begins with the victim opening a malicious PIF attachment in an email, triggering the first stage of the DoubleFinger downloader. This became known on June 13, 2023.
As a result of these actions, the criminals behind DoubleFinger gain control of the victim's crypto wallets and can withdraw funds from them.
